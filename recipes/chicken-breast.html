    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Since food for air travel needs to be prepared far in advance, airlines back in the day created a special cut of chicken breast that wouldn't dry out as much as normal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken</li>
        <li>1 drizzle olive oil</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together flour, paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Place chicken wings in a single layer in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish. Sprinkle flour mixture over top and toss until wings are evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Add about 1 inch oil to a deep, heavy skillet; heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). (The oil should be just enough to cover wings entirely.)</li>
    </ol>
